## üî• News
- MOMENT was accepted at ICML 2024!
- We are working on releasing the MOMENT research code, so you can pre-train your own time series foundation model, with your own data, and reproduce experiments from [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03885)! Stay tuned for updates!

## üìñ Introduction
We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time-series analysis. Pre-training large models on time-series data is challenging due to (1) the absence a large and cohesive public time-series repository, and (2) diverse time-series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in its nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time-series, called the Time-series Pile, and systematically tackle time-series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time-series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time-series models.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Install the package using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment.git
```

To load the pre-trained model for one of the tasks, use one of the following code snippets:

**Forecasting**
```python
from moment_timeseries import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={
        'task_name': 'forecasting',
        'forecast_horizon': 96
    },
)
model.init()
```

**Classification**
```python
from moment_timeseries import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={
        'task_name': 'classification',
        'n_channels': 1,
        'num_class': 2
    },
)
model.init()
```

**Anomaly Detection, Imputation, and Pre-training**
```python
from moment_timeseries import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={"task_name": "reconstruction"},
)
mode.init()
```

**Representation Learning**
```python
from moment_timeseries import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={'task_name': 'embedding'},
)
```

## ‚õëÔ∏è Research Code
We designed this codebase to be extremely lightweight, and in the process removed a lot of code! We are working on releasing (complete but messier) research code, which will include code to handly different datasets, and scripts for pre-training, fine-tuning and evaluating MOMENT alongside other baselines. An early version of this code is available on [Anonymous Github](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BETT-773F/README.md).

## ‚ûï Contributions
We encourage researchers to contribute their methods and datasets to MOMENT. We are actively working on contributing guidelines. Stay tuned for updates!
